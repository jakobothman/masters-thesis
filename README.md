This repository contains the code and data associated with my master's thesis, "Quantifying the Economic Impact of the Marshall Plan on Post-War Recovery." The study focuses on Spain as a case study to infer potential economic outcomes if it had been a recipient of the Marshall Plan aid post-World War II.
